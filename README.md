# Sample Hardhat Project

Here we will learn how to mint an NFT using Flashbots. This is going to be a very simple use case designed to learn how to use Flashbots, not necessarily make a profit. Finding opportunities where you can make profit using MEV is a hard problem and are typically not public information. Every Searcher is trying to do their best, and if they tell you exactly what strategies they're using, they are shooting themselves in the foot.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
